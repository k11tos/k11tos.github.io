<h1> Why AI will never replace the radiologist </h1><br />
 AI can be used to great effect to detect abnormalities in medical imaging, but it can never replace the expertise and intuition of a radiologist. In this blog post, I discuss the reasons why the radiologist's role is irreplaceable. I cover topics such as the complexity of medical imaging, the need for real-time decision-making, and the importance of empathy in the medical field. I also explain how AI can help augment the work of radiologists, rather than replace them.</body>
