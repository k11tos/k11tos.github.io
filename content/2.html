<h1> What is the essential condition of the world-best song </h1><br />
 Music is something that can stir people's hearts and emotions. And it is a great honor for a musician to be able to create a song that can be remembered and be loved by people for a long time. What is the essential condition of the world-best song? <br />
<br />
I think that music should start with a great idea. It should have a definite concept and should have a unique and attractive melody. It should also have meaningful lyrics that express the feelings and emotions of the songwriter.<br />
<br />
To get the perfect song, the songwriter has to put his/her effort into the creation of the song. They should practice and refine their composition in order to get the desired result. Also, the songwriter should be willing to experiment with different musical styles and ideas to make the song more interesting and memorable.<br />
<br />
In addition, modern technology has also helped songwriters in creating world-class songs. With the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, songwriters can create songs with complex chord progressions and unpredictable rhythms. Also, AI can help in generating melodies and lyrics which can be used to create an impressive song.<br />
<br />
Overall, it is important for the songwriter to have a great idea, practice and refine the composition, and use modern technology to their advantage in order to create the world-best song.</body>
