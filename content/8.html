<h1> Why AI will never replace the radiologist </h1><br />
 <br />
As technology advances, AI is becoming more and more important in healthcare. It can help automate many of the tedious tasks that radiologists have to do, such as image analysis. However, AI will never replace radiologists. AI may be able to take over some of the tedious tasks, but it can never completely replace the human element. Radiologists can interpret images to diagnose diseases, while AI can only detect and categorize them. AI can help radiologists make decisions, but it can never replace them. AI is a powerful tool, but it can never replace the expertise and experience of a trained radiologist.</body>
